Auto OSS License Documentation
==============================

This script will create a markdown document of all the open-source software licenses found within your project repo. 
The script will look for the usual license, copying files and parse the license type found, giving added feedback for the OSS licenses that require source to be released. 

### Usage:

bash aold.sh {-d|--debug} path/to/project
